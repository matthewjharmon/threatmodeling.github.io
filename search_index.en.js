is a tutorial / course on \"Threat Modeling from Zero to Hero\" as requested by the We Hack Purple community. The goal of this is to provide the student with a sufficient background in Threat Modeling so that they can utilize the provided resources and continue their studies and practically apply the techniques described herein. Each section will consist of a series of relevant topics with examples and exercises for the student and hopefully by the end of consuming this site the student will be able to build a personal threat model. \nThreat Model vs Risk Assessment\nA Risk Assessment 🧐 integrates a Threat Model into the process however a Threat Model can stand on it's own.\nRisk Assessments typically consist of the following areas, however they heavily overlap with Threat Modeling and often preceed a risk assessment. . \n\nSystem Characterization and Identifcation of Assets\nThreat Identification\nVulnerability Identification\nControl Analysis\nLikelihood and Impact Determination\nRisk Determination and Recommendations\n\nThese are delivered in a Risk Assessment Report and utilize the Threat Modeling to determine individual risks, vulnerabilities, and threats, then qualifies them through understanding the risk determination. \nData Flow Diagrams\nA Data Flow Diagram gives important insight into the behavior of information systems, their applications, and underlying architectural components. Note this is separate entirely from a network diagram, or system specification. The DFD is specifically focused on how data moves and is handled.\nThis is a unique way of representing the flow of data through a process or system. Most often your Data-flow diagram will include: \n\nDatabase\nInput\nSystem or Process\nOutput\nExternal Entity (Customer)\n\nThere are numerous notations however the Yourdon/DeMarco notation is the most common.\n\nfrom Wikicommons\nThreat Model as Code\nThreat Model as Code Data Flow Diagrams can be generated with software that dramatically improves the reproducibility of the process and often will expose you to routes the data may take that you hadn't considered. \nSystem Characterization and Identification of Assets\nAssets are what are at risk things that need to be protected. This process is another way of asking: \n\n\"What data do we have?\", \n\"Where is it?\" and, \n\"What are we responsible for?\" \n\nThis is typically in a spreadsheet for a small or medium sized organization or an asset database for larger enterprises and propagated as a part of log management. \nYour input consists of: \n\nNetwork Diagrams, \nHardware, \nSoftware, \nSystem interfaces, \nData and information, \nData Owners,\nSystems Administrators,\nSystem mission.\n\nThrough analyzing and organizing the data. You're able to identify IT System boundaries and scope. Produce a list of assets to be risk-managed, and a list of business\nprocesses related to the assets and their relevance.\nThreat Identification\nWhen Identifying Threat Sources interviewing the stake holders often will expedite the process, this phase typically consist of the Input of: \n\nInterview stake holders, data owners and identify supporting systems personnel,\nHistory of system attack, \nData from intelligence agencies (e.g. NIPC, OIG, ISC, FedCIRC, mass media),\nQuestionnaires and interviews of staff to assess what threats are considered valid by the organization. \n\nwith the Output of: \nIdentifying potential threat sources and compiling a threat statement listing potential sources that are applicable to the IT system being evaluated and the threat agent motivation.\nVulnerability Identification\nThe purpose of vulnerability identification in the context of a Threat Model is to understand system vulnerabilities (flaws or weaknesses) that could be exploited by the identified threat-sources, typically each vulnerability will pair up well with a specific threat and through analysis of system configurations, previous audits, and low-risk system testing develop a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities to be exploited by the identified threat agents. \nMost vulnerability identification phases will consist of gathering\n\nReports from prior risk assessments,\nAny audit comments provided regarding the systems in scope and their supporting systems,\nSecurity requirements as determined by the data classification and criticality,\nSecurity testing results from both point-in-time testing, and\nEvaluation of system logs. \n\nControl Analysis\nWhen you think of the Control Analysis phase think of these in the form of zones or areas that are explicitly, and programmatically controlled. In order to accomplish this, gathering a list of current or planned controls used for the IT systems will need to be generated. This will be used to mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited.\nThis phase only has two major input and output items. \nThe Input is a list of Current and Planned Controls along with what data or system they're associated with, and the output is that list. \nLikelihood and Impact Determination\nWithin the Likelihood and Impact Determination phase the goal is to analyze threat-source motivation, threat capacity, nature of vulnerabilities, and compare those to the currently applied controls per the asset criticality assessment, data criticality and data sensitivity, to determine the likelihood and impact of exploitation.\nThe likelihood input is the threat-source motivation, threat capacity, nature of vulnerability vs the currently deployed controls with the output being a likelihood value\nThe impact determination is based on the mission impact analysis, asset criticality assessment, data criticality, and data sensitivity with an impact rating being the output\nThreat Modeling Techniques\nThere are a large number of Threat Modeling Techniques that can be utilized but Threat Modeling of code has the option of Threat Model as Code automation. \nOutside of TM-aC there are a few prominant threat model methods\nSTRIDE\n\nSpoofing [identity] — identifying authentication threats\nTampering [with data] — identifying threats to data integrity\nRepudiation\nInformation disclosure — identifying data stewardship threats and data leaks\nDenial of service — identifying threats to availability\nElevation of privilege — identifying authorization vulnerabilities\n\nDREAD\n\nDamage [potential]\nReproducibility\nExploitability\nAffected users\nDiscoverability\n\n59972\n\n","id":"https://threatmodel.mjh.social/","title":"Threat Modeling, Zero to Hero"},"https://threatmodel.mjh.social/assets/":{"body":"Introduction\nIn it's simplest form, identifying an asset record need only consist of the most basic of information, for example the DB for the Matrix must be stored on a reliable database like PostGreSQL and this is the first primary instance. \nHostnameInternal NameExternal URLData OwnerData StoredProject\nPGSQLDBPROD1pgsqldbprod1.localnonetom.anderson90's SimMatrix v1\n\nAsset Identification\nHowever in practice, most likely will be storing their asset identification database in another database like SQLiteDB with a CSV export or if large enough Splunk or a complex process driven environment that uses a business process relationship tool like SAP may use that for their database, or a Microsoft shop may use SharePoint. \nRegardless of the method, the completeness of the Asset Identification and System Characterization is paramount to the success of your Threat Modeling exercise. \nItems to consider adding to your Asset Identifcation database: \n\nHostname\nInternal Name (or VPN name) \nExternal URL if it is supposed to be on the internet\nOwner of the data used in that system \nThe project that is responsible for the system that the data is on\n\nSystem Characterization\nThe system characterization can live in the same location as your asset identification, however it is generally a good practice to separate but have a common key between the two so that you can look the host up.
